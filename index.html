                  Hey, everyone! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Annie McFarland and I am currently enrolled in 
                  Trilogy's Coding Bootcamp at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.
                  So far, school has been very challenging, but rewarding and fun!
                  <br /><br />
                  Before my decision to begin my coding journey, I gained a lot of experience in managament and sales.
                  In 2014, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Business from Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, Missouri.
                  Shortly after, I started my career in Business Management/Sales at Sherwin-Williams Paint Company. I was soon
                  promoted to an Assistant Manager role, and two years later when the time came for a promotion to Store
                  Manager, I expressed my interest in moving to the city of San Francisco, California.
                  I was then promoted and transfered to Daly City, California where I ran my own store, and I lived in the
                  Richmond District of San Francisco, about five minutes from the Golden Gate Bridge. It was one of
                  the best times of my life!
                  <br /><br />
                  The store I ran was about 5 years old, and averaged around $400,000 in sales per
                  year. Within my first year of managing, I doubled that number and recieved mutiple awards within the Bay Area
                  district for top tier customer service. Those were some of my greatest accomplishments from that career.
                  Afterwards, I was promoted to a Property Management Outside Sales Representative for the city of San Francisco
                  and the Bay Area. However, as most of you are aware, the cost of living in San Francisco stayed high, and
                  unfortunately my salary just was not cutting it. I began my interest in software development around this time,
                  but it just didn't seem possible with my background. 
                  <br /><br />
                  Finally, I made the decision to leave my comfort zone and broaden my skill set, so I moved back home to St.
                  Louis and began working as an Account Executive in the transportation industry for Worldwide Express.
                  My desire to transition my career to web development grew stronger and stronger, and then COVID hit us hard
                  in March 2020. I began to dive into the coding world during the after hours of my corporate job, and found a love
                  for coding. However, I knew I still needed more experience and credibility. Six months later, after searcing
                  and finding several bootcamp options, I decided to take the leap with Washington University.
                  This is just the beginning, and although I realize it is very challenging, I am excited for the ride! Please
